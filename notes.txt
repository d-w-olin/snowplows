##TO DO
1. Figure out if routes are standardized (same routes every time)
2. If they are, figure out what the routes are by learning how to map Lat & Long
4. Learn about shape files and ArcGIS
5. How many miles can a plow spread salt? **20 miles/both sides of road according to Stu (wasn’t sure)**




##NOTES
1. Can derive time cost of path of each edge by analyzing data
2. Most roads need to be traveled twice; once for each direction/lane.
3. Judges are: Sam, iSchool rep, AT&T rep, DPW rep

##QUESTIONS
1. Are routes standardized (i.e. predetermined routes)?
2. Is the data incomplete (i.e. is the data sampled)? Seems to be, based on the first column. 
3. Will data be live in the future (for tracking for instance)?
4. Is there a data dictionary for the city_streets shape file?
5. How many miles can a plow spread salt before refilling?
6. Must the trucks go back and refill multiple times per shift? Where is starting point, and where is the refill location?
7. What is the strategy regarding route interruption depending on how heavy the snow is? i.e. are there certain ‘modes’ e.g. heavy snow ==> highways and emergency routes only?
8. How does the main office use the weather reports (e.g. rate of predicted snowfall effects routes), and where do they come from? 
9. Any data regarding which roads have to be traversed twice (i.e. two lanes to be plowed) versus once? Hard to optimize route on a graph without knowing.
