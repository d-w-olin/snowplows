##TO DO
1. Figure out if routes are standardized (same routes every time)
2. If they are, figure out what the routes are by learning how to map Lat & Long
3. Email any questions to Sam Edelstein (Where are the hours in the data? For a particular data file, is the time standardized for all of the different plows i.e. are they on the same time standard? Is the data we received a sample (noticed the numbers in first column)? Is it random? Can we assume that data will be live in the future? What do the column headings mean in the shape file)
4. Learn about shape files and ArcGIS
5. How many miles can a plow spread salt? **20 miles/both sides of road according to Stu (wasn’t sure)**
6. Must the trucks go back and refill multiple times per shift? Where is starting point, and where is the refill location?
7. What is the strategy regarding route interruption depending on how heavy the snow is? i.e. are there certain ‘modes’ e.g. heavy snow highways and emergency routes only?
8. How does the main office use the weather reports, and where do they come from? 

##NOTES
1. Can derive time cost of path of each edge by analyzing data
2. Most roads need to be traveled twice; once for each direction/lane.
3. test
